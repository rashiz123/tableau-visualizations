# Inferring Meaningful Insights Using Tableau-Visualizations

I worked with 3 datasets:

1) Full-year 2014 and 2015 murder counts for all U.S. cities extracted from FBI uniform crime reports.
2) World Health Organisation, Global Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH), 2010.
3) Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) dataset which is a primary source for data on colleges, universities, and technical and vocational postsecondary institutions in the United States via the National Center for Education Statistics.


Contributions:

- Dealt with data cleaning and transformation and imported out the data successfully from the source.
- Analysed the data for different aggregation options.
- Figured out meaningful insights by visualizing the place specifications along with the statistics in the datasets.
- Found out conclusions for the datasets by creating Tableau dashboards and stories.
